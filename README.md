# 🏅 The Dynamic Olympics: Exploring Changes in Athlete Profiles, Sporting Excellence, and Medal Patterns

This project presents an interactive data storytelling experience using visual analytics to trace the evolution of the modern Olympic Games. From Athens 1896 to Rio 2016, we explore how athlete demographics, sporting achievements, and medal distributions reflect broader societal, cultural, and political transformations. The dataset, originally compiled from [sports-reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/) and available via Kaggle, is rich with historical context and athlete-level detail.
